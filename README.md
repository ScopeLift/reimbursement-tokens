# Reimbursement Tokens

The repository has two subdirectories:

1. `/contracts` for the Reimbursement Token smart contracts
2. `/app` for the Reimbursement Token frontend

Eventually, this will be a monorepo where actions can be take across sub-projects from this top level directory.

For now, only the smart contracts are under development, so please navigate to the `/contracts` directory to run `yarn` commands.

The `/app` directory is a placeholder and is currently empty, but will eventually house the frontend dApp for interacting with this project.
